            Iâ€™ve been coding since 2010 after I took a 
            computer science course in C.  I didn't think 
            I was cut out for coding because I wasn't good 
            at it.  But I absolutely loved it.  Now I code 
            for a living as a back end developer at 
            Applied Medical.

            I was drum line captain in high school so 
            I have a high rhythmic and musical background.  
            I later translated those music leadership skills 
            into the UCI Step Team that I founded known as 
            Step Squad.  As a side hobby, I would also compete 
            in Super Smash Bros Melee.  I was ranked 15th in
            UCI during my last quarter there.  That might seem 
            low, but UCI is the number 1 collegient team in that 
            game.

            During College I also started my career path in 
            Information Technology in summer 2013 as a Network
            Engineer Intern. It turns out that you need a good 
            foundation of IT knowledge to understand computer 
            networks.  This did give me a head start in my next 
            job as the IT Administrative Assistant for the Child 
            Abuse Prevention Center of Orange County, where my job 
            was help desk support combined with IT Asset resource 
            management.

            I've had 2 other IT jobs after college.  One was at 
            Active IT, where I learned how much smaller companies 
            operate with their computer systems.  It was just a temp job and I 
            might have been a bit over my head as they wanted a System 
            Admin Level employee and I was just a fresh college graduate.  
        </p>
        <p>
            After Active IT, I ended up getting a job at Applied Medical as 
            a Junior Help Desk Technician.  This job wasn't difficult for me 
            at all.  I wasn't very confident in myself and I didn't know how 
            good of a technician I actually was until I came here.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was so good at being a help desk technician that I was able to 
            solve people's problems in less than 5 minutes when similar issues 
            would take other technicians 20 minutes or more.  Plus with my 
            coding background, I was able to create scripts that would automate 
            a lot of jobs for me.  The extra time I had from solving issues 
            quickly and automating jobs allowed me to focus on more coding.  
            Next thing I knew I was writing a technician phone shift scheduler 
            for our director (never got used as they'd rather manually do this.  
            Don't ask me why...)   And then, I made my own project of displaying
            on the downstairs TV who's scheduled for the phone shift, whih was 
            automated by pulling the same calendar updated by the managers.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I was given a task from my manager to assist one of the 
            company's manufacturing teams with displaying the value of a 
            Nitric Acid scale that was connected to the network.  After 
            accomplishing that quickly, the team had a new request to 
            automate emails to the team when the levels were low.  Then, 
            they wanted a database that showed the levels of Nitric Acid 
            each hour.  Eventually the app development team found out 
            that I was coding for the manufacturing team and they stepped in 
            to stop me as it wasn't my duty.  6 months later, that same team 
            ended up asking me for some assistance on the project anyways.  
        </p>
        <p>
            At around that time, the helpdesk director also asked me to 
            initiate the service desk knowledge base (so helpdesk technicians 
            would start doing things correctly and uniformly).  I was also 
            the only person who could administer the OS Deployment Server so my 
            manager at the time made me create a video tutorial on working.  
        </p>
        <p>
            So yes, I had way too many responsibilities at one point and even 
            though I am blessed to have learned so much in IT, I decided it was 
            time to become a full time back-end developer.
